⌨️ Keyboard Cheat Codes
Just type these words anywhere on the webpage to trigger special visual modes. Type them again (or refresh) to toggle them off.

matrix: Activates a Matrix theme, complete with a green digital rain canvas overlay and monospace fonts.

gravity: Watch out! All the elements on the webpage will unmoor and fall to the bottom of your screen.

fire: Ignites a smooth, animated fire particle effect at the bottom of your screen.

rainbow: Triggers an endless, psychedelic color-shifting hue rotation across the entire site.

barrelroll: The entire website does a 360-degree spin.

spin: Similar to the barrel roll, but a slightly faster 1-second spin.

mirror: Flips the entire website horizontally. Good luck reading!

debug: Outlines every single HTML element on the page in red so you can see the underlying layout boxes.

🎵 Thematic Music Secrets
The Upside Down Escape:

How to trigger: First, open the Themes menu and select the "Stranger Things" theme. Then, type the cheat code kate anywhere on the screen.

What happens: An alert warns you that you are entering the Upside Down, and the background music automatically switches to the "Kate theme" to save you.

🎮 The Konami Code
How to trigger: Use your arrow keys and keyboard to type the classic code: UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A

What happens: "Party Mode" activates! A chiptune musical chord will play, and the site's neon accent colors will swap to an intense Magenta, Yellow, and Cyan palette. (Hint: The code is subtly hidden in the footer text!)

🛠️ Developer Tools & Passive Secrets
Command Palette:

How to trigger: Press Ctrl + K (or Cmd + K on Mac).

What happens: A hidden command palette drops down. You can use it to quickly navigate the site, toggle themes, toggle music, or instantly trigger cheat modes like Matrix and Fire.

Idle Sickness:

How to trigger: Do absolutely nothing. Take your hands off the mouse and keyboard for 15 seconds.

What happens: The website gets bored. It enters an "idle" mode where the background UI blurs and the entire page begins to slowly sway back and forth in 3D space. Moving your mouse snaps it back to normal.
